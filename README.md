I go by many names, MistOfJudgement, RealEnderCreeper, MTGonPC, but you can call me Tushar.
I am currently a high school senior at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology learning various computer science topics.
You can contact me via mistofjudgement@gmail.com
Most of the projects I have are personal projects without plans to update in the future.
I don't take issue with forking repos I have because I don't plan on accepting pull requests.
