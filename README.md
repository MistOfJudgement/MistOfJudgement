I go by many usernames, MistOfJudgement, SharpMist, RealEnderCreeper, MTGonPC, but you can call me Tushar.
I am currently an undergraduate at GMU studying Computer Science
You can contact me via tusharrangaswamy@gmail.com
Most of the projects I have are personal projects without plans to update in the future.
